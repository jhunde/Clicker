> **Goal:** The goal for this project to to learn about `useState` and get familiar with it 

+ Created a `useState` that updates the **name** of a button from 'Update' to 'John Doe'
+ Created a `useState` that increments the **age** button from initial state 0
+ Added a **Reset** button that resets both **age** and **name** 

Next step is to use these tool on a project; including APIs, with a fun UI for the front-end and to use a backend as well. ðŸŽ‰
